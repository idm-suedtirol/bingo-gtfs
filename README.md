# Bingo: GTFS Export

With this repository we collect all data needed to export DIVA data to a valid GTFS format (non-realtime data only
for a first milestone) to be shown on Google maps, or other tools that support GTFS. 

All important information can be found on the [[WIKI pages|https://github.com/idm-suedtirol/bingo-gtfs/wiki]].
